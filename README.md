# pbt-sa
Implementation of the Google DeepMind paper introducing population-based training, except applied to simulated annealing instead of neural networks.

To run, simply execute `python ./sim/main.py` from the root directory. Upon first run, a `cfg.json` file will be generated and saved in the root directory. Use this to adjust the settings for running PBT.

Description of settings to come, if public demand exists.
